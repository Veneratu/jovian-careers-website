Flask Tutorial

For this project, I am follwing along with Jovian's Free Code Camp tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBDHkveJUf4

Find other tutorials from jovian at jovian.ai.

For this tutorial, the Jovian webpage would be https://jovian.com/aakashns/web-development-with-python. There is a prerequisites section with walkthroughs for Python, Git, HTML, CSS, and basic HTML/CSS templates. 

The author of the tutorial also recommended htmldog.com/guides/html

This tutorial uses Exaclidraw to draft the web page design, but pen and paper is acceptable. The term for this in web development is wireframing.

You can find good images for your website at unsplash.com. They have many royalty-free images.
